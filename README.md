I haven't investigated the TOS of this so who knows. But this script goes to packtpub's free daily e-book page. Logs you in and claims the book. I am forgetful and kind of lazy.So, instead of trying to remember to go there everyday to click the button I made this and have it set as a scheduled task on my desktop.

# Requirements:

Selenium </br>
Firefox installed on your machine.
